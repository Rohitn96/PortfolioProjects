# Helsinki Weather Prediction Project üå¶Ô∏è

## Overview

Welcome to the Helsinki Weather Prediction Project! This project focuses on forecasting tomorrow's maximum temperature (TMAX) in the Helsinki region using data science and machine learning techniques. Whether you're a local or an immigrant navigating Finland's unique climate, this project aims to provide insights and aid in weather planning.

## Dataset

The weather data is sourced from NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration), offering a comprehensive view of historical weather patterns in Helsinki.

## Features

- **Data Standardization:** Preprocessed the dataset, handling missing values and standardizing features.
  
- **Model Building:** Implemented a Ridge Regression model using Python and scikit-learn to predict TMAX.

- **Backtesting:** A custom backtesting function is included, allowing users to evaluate the model's performance on historical data.

## Visualizations

Explore visualizations that showcase the model's accuracy in predicting TMAX and absolute differences over time.
