# English Premier League Match Web Scraping and Outcome Prediction

## English Premier League Match Outcome Prediction

This Python script is designed to predict the outcomes of English Premier League (EPL) matches using a Random Forest Classifier. It makes use of historical EPL match data to train and test the machine learning model.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries (Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn)

### Getting Started
1. Clone this repository or download the provided code file.
2. Ensure you have Python and the required libraries installed.
3. Place your EPL match data in a CSV file named "matches.csv." The data should include information about match dates, teams, scores, and relevant attributes.
4. Modify the code as needed, especially if your dataset structure differs significantly from the example provided.
5. Run the Python script.

### Usage
- The script will load and clean the EPL match dataset.
- It sets up a Random Forest Classifier with defined hyperparameters.
- The dataset is split into training and test sets.
- The model is trained on the training data and evaluated on the test data.
- The script outputs the accuracy of the model in predicting EPL match outcomes.

## Web Scraping

The Python script for web scraping allows you to collect data from websites. In this case, you can use it to scrape EPL match information from websites that provide match statistics and scores.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries (Requests, BeautifulSoup)

### Getting Started
1. Clone this repository or download the provided code file.
2. Ensure you have Python and the required libraries installed.
3. Configure the script to scrape data from your chosen website(s) by modifying the URL(s), HTML structure, and data extraction methods.
4. Run the Python script.

### Usage
- The script will send HTTP requests to the specified website(s).
- It will parse the HTML content using BeautifulSoup to extract relevant data such as match scores, team names, and dates.
- You can save this scraped data in a CSV file for further analysis or use it in the EPL match outcome prediction script.
